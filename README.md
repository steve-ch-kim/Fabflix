# Fabflix

Fabflix is a web-based ecommerce system, that allows customers to locate movies, place them in a shopping cart, and checkout/pay with Stripe (similar to PayPal). The design uses microservices, identity management, and an API gateway. This application is also designed for security and scalability. Fabflix is implemented with the IMDb API, which allows access to the database of information on over 250,000 movies and TV shows. The API provides access to over 3 million data items, including cast & crew info, plot summaries, release dates, and ratings. It also offers an image server with over 1 million images related to movies and TV shows.
